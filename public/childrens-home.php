                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 1992 by <strong>Father Angelo D’Agostino</strong> and <strong>Sister Mary Owens</strong>, Nyumbani Children’s Home was Kenya's first hospice for HIV-positive orphans. At a time when other orphanages turned away HIV-infected infants, Fr. D'Agostino took matters into his own hands to provide a refuge of hope and dignity.</p>
                    <p>Today, the home has evolved from a hospice into a thriving residence for approximately 100 children, ranging from newborns to 23-year-olds.</p>
